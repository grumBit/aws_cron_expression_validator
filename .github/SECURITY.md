## Reporting a Vulnerability

Please report (suspected) security vulnerabilities by creating an [issue](https://github.com/grumbit/aws_cron_expression_validator/issues), which will send
an automated email to **[bitjugglers@gmail.com](mailto:bitjugglers@gmail.com)**.

You will hopefully receive a response within 2-3 days, however, this is a personal
side-project, so it may take longer. If the issue is confirmed, a patch will be released
as soon as possible depending on complexity but hopefully within a few days.
